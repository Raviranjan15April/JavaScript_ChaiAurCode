/*
variable can be created by using "var", "let" & "const" keywords.
variable created by "const" will not change. that's why it is constant.
variable created by "var" & "let" can be change in future.
Note:- we can create variable without giving any keywords, but avoid to create variable like this.

Note:- avoid to create variable by "var" keyword becouse there is limitation as block scope.
